Big Data Analysis on Netflix Dataset Using Apache Spark and Python (Kaggle)
This project presents an in-depth big data analysis of a Netflix dataset using Apache Spark and Python, conducted on the Kaggle platform. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights from large-scale user and content data to better understand viewer behavior, content preferences, and platform usage trends.

Project Overview
The Netflix dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains extensive metadata about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. It includes attributes such as title, genre, cast, director, country, release year, and date added to the platform. Some versions of the dataset also include user activity and ratings (depending on the specific Kaggle dataset variant used).

The analysis leverages Apache Spark to efficiently process and analyze this large dataset. Spark's distributed computing capabilities were especially useful in handling and transforming the data, running aggregate queries, and building scalable data pipelines.

Tools and Technologies
Kaggle: Hosted the dataset and served as the platform for development and execution.

Apache Spark (PySpark): Used for scalable data processing and analysis.

Python: Primary language for scripting and analysis.

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: Used alongside Spark for local data manipulation and visualization.

Jupyter Notebooks: Provided an interactive development environment on Kaggle.

Key Steps and Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Removed nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Normalized text fields for consistency.

Parsed complex columns like cast lists and genres.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed content release trends over time.

Investigated genre popularity by region and year.

Identified the most frequently featured actors and directors.

Compared the distribution of movies vs. TV shows across countries.

Insights & Observations:

The number of Netflix Originals has significantly increased since 2015.

Drama and comedy dominate globally, but regional preferences vary.

India, the US, and the UK are the top countries by content volume.

Some directors and actors have a disproportionately high representation.

Big Data Techniques:

Used Sparkâ€™s RDDs and DataFrames to process millions of records.

Grouped and aggregated large volumes of data efficiently.

Applied transformations to generate meaningful KPIs and metrics.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how big data tools like Apache Spark can be applied to media streaming datasets to derive actionable insights. By using the Kaggle platform for computation and storage, this analysis remains reproducible and easily shareable. The insights from this project could help inform content strategy, personalization, and recommendation systems for streaming services.
